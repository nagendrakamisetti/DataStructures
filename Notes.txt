Algorithm is set of instructions in the computer for solving a particular problem.
such sorting, searching.

Big O Notation/Asymptotic notation is used to measure the Algorithm speed.

1. Linear Growth rate or Linear complexity. O(n) = single loop
fining no.of evens in a given array.
public int countEvens(int elements[]) {
int count = 0;
for (int i =0; i< elements.length)
 if (elemen)


}
for (int i =0; i<

2. constant Growth rate. O(1)

public int getElementFrom(int a[], int index) {
	return a[index];
}

3. Nested Growth rate. O(n2). Quadratic = loop inside a loop. which means squared.
 count duplicates in two arrays.
 
public int countDuplicates(int items1[], int items2[]) {
int count = 0;
for (int i =0; i< elements.length)
 if (elemen)


}

cubic notation. O(n3)


ds.stack.Stack: LIFO. Last in first out.

primary operations
push: adding item
pop: removing an item

peak: returns top element from the ds.stack.
isEmpty: 
isFull:
