Algorithm is set of instructions in the computer for solving a particular problem.
such as sorting, searching.

Big O Notation/Asymptotic notation is used to measure the Algorithm speed.

1. Linear Growth rate or Linear complexity. 
Alogirithm iterated entire list of elements once is called linear.
O(n) = single loop
finding no.of evens in a given array.
public int countEvens(int elements[]) {
int count = 0;
for (int i =0; i < elements.length; i++)
	 if (element[i]%2 == 0) {
	   count ++;
	 }
 }
return count;
}

2. Constant Time. O(1)

public int getElementFrom(int a[], int index) {
	return a[index];
}

3. Nested Growth rate. O(n2). Quadratic = loop inside a loop. which means squared.
 count duplicates in two arrays.
 
public int countDuplicates(int items1[], int items2[]) {
int count = 0;
for (int i =0; i< items1.length; i++) {
	for (int j = 0; j< items2.length; j++) {
		if (items[i] == items[2]) {
			count ++;
		}	
         }
}
return count;
}

Linear and Quadratic are called as Growth Rates.
4. Cubic notation. O(n power 3)
5. Exponential O(n power n)

ds.stack.Stack: LIFO. Last in first out.

primary operations
push: adding item
pop: removing an item

peak: returns top element from the ds.stack.
isEmpty: 
isFull:
